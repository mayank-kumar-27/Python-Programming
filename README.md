- **07-Strings**: String basics, operations, formatting, f-strings, string methods
- **08-Functions**: Function definition, parameters, return values, lambda functions, recursion
- **09-Object-Oriented-Programming**: Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation
- **10-Exception-Handling**: Try-except blocks, custom exceptions, error handling
- **11-File-Handling**: File reading/writing, text/binary files, file operations
- **12-Built-in-Functions**: Common built-in functions, modules, standard library usage

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed (download from python.org)
- Text editor or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)

### Running Python Programs
```bash
# Run a Python program
python filename.py

# Or using python3
python3 filename.py
```

### Example
```bash
# Navigate to a folder
cd 01-Basics

# Run hello world program
python 01_hello_world.py
```

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Start with Basics**: Begin with folder 01-Basics
2. **Follow the Sequence**: Progress through folders in numerical order
3. **Read Documentation**: Each folder contains a detailed README.md
4. **Practice**: Run programs, modify code, and experiment
5. **Apply Knowledge**: Create your own programs using learned concepts

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Progressive Learning**: From simple to complex concepts
- **Practical Examples**: Real-world programming scenarios
- **Well-Documented**: Detailed explanations in each folder
- **Hands-on Practice**: Hundreds of programs to run and modify
- **Interactive Learning**: Immediate feedback and experimentation

## 📝 Learning Tips

- Type code manually instead of copying
- Experiment with different inputs and edge cases
- Add your own comments and modifications
- Practice regularly and review concepts
- Build small projects to apply what you've learned
