# 04-Tuples

## Theory
This folder covers tuples in Python, which are immutable sequences used to store collections of items. Tuples are similar to lists but cannot be modified after creation. Key concepts include:
- Tuple creation and initialization
- Indexing and slicing
- Tuple methods (count, index)
- Immutability
- Packing and unpacking
- Tuple operations (concatenation, repetition)
- Nested tuples
- Named tuples

## Objective
The objective of this folder is to teach tuple usage in Python, enabling learners to work with immutable collections of data.
