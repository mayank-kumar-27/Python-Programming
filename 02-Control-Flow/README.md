# 02-Control-Flow

## Theory
This folder covers control flow statements in Python, including conditional statements and loops. These are essential for making decisions and repeating actions in programs. Key concepts include:
- Conditional statements (if, elif, else)
- Loops (for, while)
- Loop control (break, continue, pass)
- Nested structures
- Pattern printing with loops

## Objective
The objective of this folder is to teach control flow mechanisms in Python, enabling learners to write programs that can make decisions and iterate over data.
