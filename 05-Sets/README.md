# 05-Sets

## Theory
This folder covers sets in Python, which are unordered collections of unique elements. Sets are useful for membership testing and eliminating duplicates. Key concepts include:
- Set creation and initialization
- Set methods (add, remove, update, discard)
- Set operations (union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference)
- Set relationships (subset, superset, disjoint)
- Set comprehension
- Frozen sets
- Practical uses of sets

## Objective
The objective of this folder is to teach set operations in Python, enabling learners to work with unique collections and perform mathematical set operations.
