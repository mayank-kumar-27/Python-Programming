# Exception Handling

## Theory
Exception handling is a mechanism in programming to handle runtime errors so that the normal flow of the application can be maintained. In Python, exceptions are raised when errors occur at runtime. The try-except block is used to catch and handle these exceptions. Proper exception handling makes programs more robust and user-friendly by preventing crashes and providing meaningful error messages.

## Objective
The objective of this section is to learn how to handle exceptions in Python effectively. By the end of this section, you should be able to:
- Understand what exceptions are and when they occur
- Use try-except blocks to catch exceptions
- Handle different types of exceptions appropriately
- Create custom exceptions
- Use finally blocks for cleanup operations
- Apply best practices for exception handling

## Conclusion
Exception handling is crucial for writing reliable Python programs. This section has covered the fundamentals of exception handling, from basic try-except blocks to advanced concepts like custom exceptions and exception chaining. Remember to catch specific exceptions rather than using broad exception handlers, and always use finally blocks for necessary cleanup operations. Practice these concepts to make your programs more robust and user-friendly.
